# Tutorial: Merging Waves into a Tracker

Tracking studies tabulate the *same* questions every month, then need two things
DP does by hand all the time:

1. **Roll up** several waves into one combined table (e.g. three months → a quarter).
2. **Line up** the same question across periods, side by side, in one tracker view.

MRScript does both *after* tabulation, with `ADDTAB` (roll-up) and `BANKED_TABLE`
(side-by-side). They post-process finished tables — no extra data passes — so they
stay fast and exact. This tutorial builds both from one dataset.

## Setup — one dataset, a wave indicator

The engine tabulates one dataset per run, so the cleanest pattern is a single file
that carries a `wave` column (combine monthly files with `APPEND`, or add the column
in fieldwork). Our file `tracker.sav` has:

| Variable | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `$respondent_id` | respondent key |
| `$wave` | 1 = Jan, 2 = Feb, 3 = Mar |
| `$q1` | overall satisfaction (1–5) |
| `$region` | North / South / East / West |

```mrs
SOURCE "tracker.sav"
%RESPID = $respondent_id
```

## Step 1 — Tabulate each wave, and give it a NAME

Tabulate the same question once per wave, filtering to that wave. The `NAME` clause
registers each table under a short handle so the cross-table ops can find it (without
`NAME`, a table is addressed by its title — awkward when every wave shares one).

```mrs
TABLE 'Satisfaction — Jan' NAME 'Jan'
  STUBS  $q1
  BANNER $region
  FILTER $wave = 1
  STATS  col_pct, n
END TABLE

TABLE 'Satisfaction — Feb' NAME 'Feb'
  STUBS  $q1
  BANNER $region
  FILTER $wave = 2
  STATS  col_pct, n
END TABLE

TABLE 'Satisfaction — Mar' NAME 'Mar'
  STUBS  $q1
  BANNER $region
  FILTER $wave = 3
  STATS  col_pct, n
END TABLE
```

Each is an ordinary table — they render on their own, too.

---

## Step 2 — Roll the waves up with `ADDTAB`

```mrs
ADDTAB 'Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar'
  TITLE 'Satisfaction — Q1 roll-up'
  NAME  'Q1'
```

This produces one table whose **counts are the sum** of the three waves, cell by
cell. Crucially, the percentages are **recomputed from the combined counts and
bases** — not averaged — so the roll-up is the true quarter figure, not a mean of
three monthly percentages. If you had a `Mean` row (e.g. a scored scale), it
re-derives correctly from the pooled sufficient statistics.

The sources must share the **same layout** — same stubs (`$q1`) and the same banner
columns (`$region`). They do here, so the merge succeeds; a layout mismatch raises a
clear error naming the offending stubs.

!!! note "Significance is not carried over"

    `ADDTAB` and `BANKED_TABLE` clear significance flags: the source flags were
    computed over each wave's smaller base, so they don't describe the combined
    result. If you want fresh significance on the quarter, tabulate `$q1` once with
    `FILTER $wave IN (1, 2, 3)` and `STATS … sig` instead of merging.

---

## Step 3 — Line the waves up with `BANKED_TABLE`

A roll-up hides the *trend*. To see Jan, Feb and Mar next to each other, bank them:

```mrs
BANKED_TABLE 'Jan' 'Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar'
  TITLE 'Satisfaction tracker'
```

Read the first name as the **stub source** — it supplies the rows (`$q1`'s
categories). The remaining names are the tables whose banner columns are placed
side by side, left to right. Here we list `'Jan'` again so its own columns appear in
the tracker; if you only wanted Feb and Mar columns against Jan's row layout, you'd
write `BANKED_TABLE 'Jan' 'Feb', 'Mar'`.

Because every wave has a `Total` (and `North`, `South`, …) column, the duplicate
labels are disambiguated with each source's title, e.g.
`Total (Satisfaction — Jan)`. The output is one wide table — rows are the `$q1`
categories, columns run Jan ‖ Feb ‖ Mar.

---

## The finished script

```mrs
SOURCE "tracker.sav"
%RESPID = $respondent_id

TABLE 'Satisfaction — Jan' NAME 'Jan'
  STUBS $q1 BANNER $region FILTER $wave = 1 STATS col_pct, n
END TABLE
TABLE 'Satisfaction — Feb' NAME 'Feb'
  STUBS $q1 BANNER $region FILTER $wave = 2 STATS col_pct, n
END TABLE
TABLE 'Satisfaction — Mar' NAME 'Mar'
  STUBS $q1 BANNER $region FILTER $wave = 3 STATS col_pct, n
END TABLE

ADDTAB 'Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar' TITLE 'Satisfaction — Q1 roll-up' NAME 'Q1'
BANKED_TABLE 'Jan' 'Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar' TITLE 'Satisfaction tracker'
```

Running it produces five tables: the three monthly waves, the Q1 roll-up (combined
counts), and the side-by-side tracker — numbered sequentially in that order.

## What you've learned

- **`TABLE … NAME 'handle'`** registers a table so cross-table ops can address it.
- **`ADDTAB`** sums same-layout tables into a roll-up, recomputing percentages and
  means over the combined base.
- **`BANKED_TABLE`** concatenates several tables' banners side by side; the first
  name is the stub source (rows only — list it again to include its columns).
- Both run after tabulation, reference sources declared **earlier**, and clear
  significance flags.
