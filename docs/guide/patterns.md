## Profile table (counts + %, masked small bases)

A clean sample-profile table with a low-base mask.

```mrs
FORMAT
  STATS      n, col_pct
  BASE_LABEL 'Respondents'
  MIN_BASE   20 MASK 'n<20'
END FORMAT

TABLE 'Sample profile'
  STUBS @age_group, $gender, $region
END TABLE
```

`STUBS a, b, c` stacks three sections in one table. See
[STUBS](../reference/tables.md#row-axis).

---

## Crosstab with significance

```mrs
TABLE 'Brushing frequency by age'
  STUBS  $q5
  BANNER @age_group
  STATS  n, col_pct, sig
END TABLE
```

Configure the test with [`CONFIG SIG_CONFIDENCE / SIG_COMPARE / SIG_CORRECTION`](../reference/setup-blocks.md#config).

---

## Choose a significance strategy (one-tailed / FDR / exact-t / design effect)

Tune *how* the test runs with four composable `CONFIG` knobs — useful for directional
hypotheses, many-column banners, small-base means, and clustered samples:

```mrs
CONFIG
  SIG_CONFIDENCE  95
  SIG_TAILS       1          -- one-tailed: only flag a column that is HIGHER
  SIG_MEAN_TEST   exact_t    -- exact Student-t for Mean rows (the default)
  SIG_CORRECTION  bh         -- Benjamini–Hochberg FDR (more power than bonferroni)
  SIG_DEFF        1.5        -- clustered design: inflate the SE by √1.5
END CONFIG

TABLE 'Agreement by region'
  STUBS  $agree
  BANNER $region
  STATS  col_pct, n, mean, sig
END TABLE
```

- **`SIG_TAILS 1`** — directional test (cut drops to `z₀.₀₅ = 1.645` at 95%).
- **`SIG_MEAN_TEST exact_t`** (default) — honest at tiny bases (df 2 needs `t = 4.30`,
  not `z = 1.96`); use `normal` for the old z-approximation.
- **`SIG_CORRECTION bh`** — controls the false-discovery rate; sits between `none`
  (most flags) and `bonferroni` (fewest) when several differences are real.
- **`SIG_DEFF 1.5`** — a rough complex-sample correction (deflates the effective bases).

## Sort a table by a banner column

Order rows by the value in any banner column — here, brands ranked by their share
in the *Female* column, high→low. Columns are named by **variable + code**, not by
label.

```mrs
TABLE 'Brand awareness by gender'
  STUBS  $brand
  BANNER $gender
  STATS  col_pct, n
  SORT   col_pct DESC ON $gender = 2   // Female column; omit ON to sort by Total
END TABLE
```

`SORT` keeps structure intact — `NET` and `HEADING` rows stay anchored and summary
rows (Mean / Std) stay at the bottom. `RANKING descending` is the shorthand for
"sort by the Total column". Full options in [§17 Sorting rows](../reference/tables.md#sorting).

---

## Clean, label and tabulate a coded CSV

CSV columns carry no labels, so label them yourself (or supply a `CODEBOOK`).

```mrs
SOURCE 'raw.csv' CODEBOOK 'book.json'
DROP ROWS WHERE $status != 1               // completes only
EDIT $age SET 999 WHERE $age > 120         // flag impossible ages
VARIABLE $age MISSING 999 END VARIABLE     // then exclude them

TABLE 'Age distribution'
  DISTRIBUTION $age
  STATS n, col_pct, mean
END TABLE
```

`DISTRIBUTION` builds rows from the **actual codes present** in the data — handy for
auditing. See [DISTRIBUTION](../reference/tables.md#row-axis).

---

## Top-2-Box via RECODE

When you just need a quick collapse (no NET sub-rows), `RECODE` is the fastest route.

```mrs
RECODE $q1 (1,2,3 -> 1 "Bottom 3") (4,5 -> 2 "Top 2") INTO @q1_t2b

TABLE 'Satisfaction (T2B)'
  STUBS  @q1_t2b
  BANNER @region
END TABLE
```

For a T2B that keeps its member rows visible, use a `NET` inside `DERIVE` (see the
[tutorial, Step 7](../tutorial/first-crosstab.md#step-7-add-net-rows-top-2-box)).

---

## Export multi-response variables

`EXPORT DATA` on a script that includes a `DERIVE` automatically expands each
multi-response `@` variable into N separate `0`/`1` columns — one per leaf stub code —
before writing. No extra keywords required.

```mrs
SOURCE 'survey.sav'

DERIVE @brand
    STUB 1 'Colgate'   WHERE $q_colgate = 1
    STUB 2 'Sensodyne' WHERE $q_sensodyne = 1
    STUB 3 'Oral-B'    WHERE $q_oralb = 1
END DERIVE

TABLE 'Brand usage'
    STUBS @brand
    STATS n, col_pct
END TABLE

// Export produces brand_1, brand_2, brand_3 columns (0/1 Int)
EXPORT DATA 'clean.sav'
EXPORT DATA 'clean.csv' CODEBOOK 'brand_meta.json'
```

The companion codebook records each dichotomy as a `multi_binary` variable with the
stub label as the variable label — ready to re-apply on a future `SOURCE … CODEBOOK`.

**Notes:**

- `SOURCE_ONLY` drops the dichotomies (they are still `source_format = "derived"`).
- `.parquet` exports the native `List[Int64]` column unchanged — use it when you
  need the original multi-code structure.
- NET and HEADING stubs do not produce dichotomy columns (only leaf stubs do).

---

## Computed index

```mrs
COMPUTE @bmi = $weight / ($height * $height)

TABLE 'BMI'
  DISTRIBUTION @bmi
  STATS mean, std_dev
END TABLE
```

See [COMPUTE](../reference/data-preparation.md#compute).

---

## Profile a table against the total (INDEX)

`INDEX` re-expresses every distribution cell as an index versus a reference banner
column (100 = parity, >100 over-indexes, <100 under-indexes). The default reference
is the Total column; use `ON $var = code` to pick a specific column.

```mrs
TABLE 'Brand consideration — profile'
  STUBS   $brand
  BANNER  $gender
  STATS   col_pct, n
  INDEX                   // reference = Total column
  DECIMALS 0              // whole-number indices read more cleanly
END TABLE
```

The Total column always reads 100 because it is the reference. Base rows are
inherited unchanged (real respondent counts). NET rows are indexed normally; HEADING
rows stay blank; significance is cleared (a ratio has no single base to test).

Combine with `SORT` to order rows by the pre-index rate before rescaling:

```mrs
TABLE 'Brand profile — sorted then indexed'
  STUBS  $brand
  BANNER $gender
  STATS  col_pct, n
  SORT   col_pct DESC      // order by Total % first
  INDEX                    // then re-express as index
  DECIMALS 0
END TABLE
```

To index to a specific column instead of the Total, use `ON`:

```mrs
  INDEX ON $gender = 2     // Female column = 100; other columns vs Female
```

See [Index / profile tables](../reference/tables.md#index).

---

## Combine waves, then tabulate (APPEND)

Stack the rows of two files into one dataset.

```mrs
SOURCE w1 'wave1.sav'
SOURCE w2 'wave2.sav'
APPEND w1, w2

TABLE 'Awareness (pooled)'
  STUBS  $aware
  BANNER $wave
END TABLE
```

---

## Wave-on-wave change with MANIP

Tabulate the same question for two periods, then subtract them cell by cell for a
percentage-point delta table (positive = up, negative = down). `MANIP` reads
stored tables — never the data — so the two sources just need the same layout.

```mrs
TABLE 'Awareness — 2025' NAME 'A25' STUBS $brand BANNER $region STATS col_pct, n END TABLE
TABLE 'Awareness — 2024' NAME 'A24' STUBS $brand BANNER $region STATS col_pct, n END TABLE

MANIP 'A25' - 'A24' ON col_pct TITLE 'Awareness Δ (2025 vs 2024)' NAME 'AwDelta'
```

Swap the operator for other table maths: `'A25' INDEX 'A24'` (index this year to
last, 100 = no change), or `'BrandA' SHARE 'Category'` (a brand's count as a % of
the category). See [MANIP](../reference/tables.md#manip).

---

## Wave-on-wave significance (SIG_COMPARE prior)

When the waves sit side by side in **one banner**, `SIG_COMPARE prior` tests each
column against the one immediately before it — the "is this wave significantly
up/down on the last?" read — instead of the full round-robin.

```mrs
CONFIG
  SIG_CONFIDENCE 95
  SIG_COMPARE    prior      -- each wave vs the wave before it
END CONFIG

TABLE 'Awareness by wave'
  STUBS  $brand
  BANNER $wave              -- Q1 (A)  Q2 (B)  Q3 (C)  Q4 (D)
  STATS  col_pct, n, sig
END TABLE
```

A rise is flagged on the later wave (Q2 carrying **A** = up vs Q1); a fall is
flagged on the higher/earlier wave (Q3 carrying **D** = awareness dropped into Q4).
Only adjacent waves are compared — Q3 never carries Q1's letter. The two columns are
treated as **independent samples** (correct for a fresh-sample tracker); for a
same-respondent panel read the flags as approximate, or set `SUPPRESS_WAVE_SIG true`.
See [SIG_COMPARE](../reference/setup-blocks.md#config).

---

## Add profiling variables by JOIN

Match a profile file onto your main file by respondent key.

```mrs
SOURCE main 'respondents.sav'
SOURCE prof 'profile.sav'
%RESPID = $respondent_id
JOIN main WITH prof ON %RESPID

TABLE 'Brand by income'
  STUBS  $brand
  BANNER $income
END TABLE
```

See [APPEND / JOIN](../reference/data-input.md#append--join).

---

## Statistics card (summary only)

Show just the mean/std/median rows, hiding the distribution.

```mrs
TABLE 'Q1 mean by segment'
  STUBS  $q1
  BANNER @age_group
  STATS + mean, std_dev, std_error, median
  STATS_ONLY
END TABLE
```

---

## Rotated concept test (STACK)

Reshape three rotated concept slots into one long frame, then tabulate at that level.

```mrs
STACK @trial
  POSITIONS 1..3
  MAP @product = $I_#_Product_Shown
  MAP @overall = $I_#_Q1
END STACK

TABLE 'Liking by product'
  LEVEL @trial  STUBS @overall  BANNER @product
END TABLE

TABLE 'Reach (unique respondents)'
  LEVEL @trial  STUBS @product  BASE respondents
END TABLE
```

See [STACK](../reference/data-preparation.md#stack).

---

## Clean and export a reproducible dataset

```mrs
SOURCE 'raw.sav'
DROP ROWS WHERE $speeder = 1
RECODE  $q1 (1,2 -> 1) (3,4,5 -> 2) INTO @q1_grp
COMPUTE @score = ($q1 + $q2 + $q3) / 3

EXPORT DATA 'clean.sav'                       // metadata-complete SPSS
EXPORT DATA 'clean.csv' CODEBOOK 'book.json'  // portable data + metadata
```

See [EXPORT DATA](../reference/output.md#export-data).

---

## Diary / nested-loop data (day × occasion)

```mrs
SOURCE 'diary.sav'
%RESPID = $RESPID

STACK @diary
  AXIS day      1..2
  AXIS occasion 1..2
  MAP @day      AT day      FROM $DAY_1, $DAY_2
  MAP @beverage AT occasion FROM $BEV_1_1, $BEV_1_2, $BEV_2_1, $BEV_2_2
  DROP EMPTY @beverage = NULL, 99            // remove unfilled occasions
END STACK

// @day_n, @occasion_n, @diary_slot auto-emitted

TABLE 'Beverages by day'
  STUBS @beverage  BANNER @day_n  LEVEL @diary
END TABLE

TABLE 'Beverage penetration (unique respondents)'
  STUBS @beverage  LEVEL @diary  BASE respondents
END TABLE
```

See [Multi-axis STACK](../reference/data-preparation.md#stack).

---

## Roll up diary data before tabulating (AGGREGATE)

When the raw file is **one row per exposure / trip / transaction** but you tabulate at
the respondent level, `AGGREGATE` collapses it to one row per respondent first — sum
the spend, count the trips, average the rating, and keep the (constant-per-respondent)
brand and demographics with `FIRST`.

```mrs
SOURCE 'shopper_trips.sav'        // many rows per shopper

AGGREGATE TO respondent
  BY     $respondent_id
  COLUMN $spend   SUM             // total spend       → $spend (numeric)
  COLUMN $trip    COUNT           // number of trips    → $trip  (numeric)
  COLUMN $basket  MEAN            // mean basket value  → $basket
  COLUMN $segment FIRST           // keeps its labels   → $segment (categorical)
END AGGREGATE

%RESPID = $respondent_id

TABLE 'Total spend'   DISTRIBUTION $spend STATS n, mean END TABLE
TABLE 'Trips'         DISTRIBUTION $trip  STATS n, mean END TABLE
TABLE 'Spend by segment'
  STUBS $segment  STATS col_pct, n, mean
END TABLE
```

`SUM`/`COUNT`/`MEAN`/`MIN`/`MAX` become numeric columns; `FIRST`/`LAST` inherit the
source variable's labels (so `$segment` still tabulates by its categories). Two
aggregates of the **same** column are suffixed — `COLUMN $rating MEAN` + `COLUMN
$rating MAX` → `$rating_mean`, `$rating_max`. Columns you don't name are dropped, so
declare everything you want to keep.

See [AGGREGATE](../reference/data-input.md#aggregate).

---

## Rating battery as a GRID

Several rating statements side-by-side as columns, each showing its own
distribution + NETs + mean.

```mrs
DERIVE @s1
  NET 'Top 2 Box'    STUB 5 'Strongly agree' WHERE $s1 = 5
                     STUB 4 'Agree'          WHERE $s1 = 4   ENDNET
  STUB 3 'Neutral'   WHERE $s1 = 3
  NET 'Bottom 2 Box' STUB 2 'Disagree'          WHERE $s1 = 2
                     STUB 1 'Strongly disagree' WHERE $s1 = 1  ENDNET
  SCORE 1=1 SCORE 2=2 SCORE 3=3 SCORE 4=4 SCORE 5=5
END DERIVE
// ... @s2, @s3 defined the same way ...

TABLE 'Agreement battery' TYPE GRID
  COLUMN @s1 LABEL 'Statement 1'
  COLUMN @s2 LABEL 'Statement 2'
  COLUMN @s3 LABEL 'Statement 3'
  STATS col_pct, mean
END TABLE
```

See [GRID tables](../reference/tables.md#grid-tables).

---

## Top-box summary of a rating battery (SUMMARY)

Consolidate a whole battery into one table: a block per measure (Top-2-Box, Mean, …),
one row per statement, with demographic banner columns and significance. No need to
pre-derive nets — `MEASURE` builds the boxes from the scale.

```mrs
TABLE 'Agreement battery — summary' TYPE SUMMARY
  STATEMENTS $s1, $s2, $s3
  SCALE 1..5                       -- shared scale; or omit if the vars carry value labels
  MEASURE TOP 2    'Top-2-Box'
  MEASURE BOTTOM 2 'Bottom-2-Box'
  MEASURE mean     'Mean'
  BANNER  $gender
  STATS   col_pct, n, sig
END TABLE
```

Each statement's box % is over its own valid base; significance compares the banner
columns. See [Summary tables](../reference/tables.md#summary).

## Find the best product line with TURF (`TYPE TURF`)

Which few flavours / claims / SKUs together reach the most buyers? A TURF table finds
the **best portfolio at each size** and reports its unduplicated **reach**, the
**incremental** lift each added item brings, and the average **frequency** of use.

```mrs
TABLE 'Flavour line — TURF' TYPE TURF
  ITEMS  $flav_choc, $flav_van, $flav_straw, $flav_mint   -- 0/1 "would buy" flags
  SIZE   1..3                                             -- the reach curve
  REPORT reach, incremental, frequency
  METHOD auto                                             -- exact for small sets, else greedy
END TABLE
```

```
                                       Reach %   Incremental   Frequency
Chocolate                                 40.0          40.0        0.40
Chocolate + Strawberry                    80.0          40.0        0.80
Chocolate + Strawberry + Mint             80.0           0.0        1.10
```

`ITEMS` can also be a single multi-response `@list` (one item per code) or a single
categorical `$var` (one item per value). Reach honours `FILTER` / `SCOPE` and `WEIGHT`
(weighted reach). See [TURF analysis](../reference/tables.md#turf).

---

## Report NPS with significance (`nps`)

Add the `nps` stat to any table on a 0–10 recommend question — it appends a signed
**NPS** row (%promoters[9–10] − %detractors[0–6], passives in the base), and with
`sig` it tests columns using the correct difference-of-proportions variance.

```mrs
TABLE 'Likelihood to recommend' STUBS $recommend
  BANNER $gender
  STATS  col_pct, n, nps, sig
END TABLE
```

```text
  NPS                              0          40         -40
                                               B
```

Bands default to 0–10; override with `NPS PROMOTERS 9..10 DETRACTORS 0..6` (e.g. for a
1–10 scale) and set `NPS_DECIMALS 1` if you want a decimal place. NPS also works as a
`TYPE SUMMARY` measure (`MEASURE nps "NPS"`) and wave-merges under `ADDTAB`. See
[NPS](../reference/reference-details.md#nps).

---

## Pool two questions into one section (ADD)

When two questions share a code frame and you want their responses to **add up**.

```mrs
TABLE 'Total brand awareness (Q1 + Q2)'
  ADD    @q1_brand, @q2_brand SECTION LABEL 'Any mention'
  BANNER $gender
  STATS  col_pct, n, sig
END TABLE
```

See [ADD](../reference/tables.md#row-axis).

## Tab the whole survey (AUTOTAB)

Generate one banner table per codebook variable, instead of hand-writing a `TABLE`
block for every question.

```mrs
%RESPID = $respondent_id

FORMAT
  STATS  col_pct, n, sig
  BANNER $gender, $region
END FORMAT

AUTOTAB VARS()          -- every tabulatable variable, crossed by the FORMAT banner
END AUTOTAB
```

Filter to a themed subset and override the banner just for that block:

```mrs
AUTOTAB VARS(TYPE single_punch, LIKE "att_*", EXCLUDE $att_other)
  BANNER @age_group
  SORT   col_pct DESC
  SHEET  "Attitudes"
END AUTOTAB
```

`VARS()` selects source variables in codebook order (`open_end`, the `%RESPID` and
weights excluded); each generated table is a normal banner table that inherits
`FORMAT` and any clause you put on the block. See
[AUTOTAB / VARS()](../reference/tables.md#auto-tab).

---

## Draft a table from plain English (`assist`)

When you know *what* you want but not the exact clause spelling, let the assistant
write the block — it is grounded on your dataset's variables and validates its own
output through the real parser before showing it.

```
mrscript assist "tab q1 by gender and region with col%, n, sig and the mean" --data survey.sav
```

```mrs
TABLE "Overall Satisfaction"
    STUBS $q1
    BANNER $gender, $region
    STATS col_pct, n, sig, mean
END TABLE
```

It also writes `DERIVE` blocks (`--type derive`), and `--out FILE` saves the snippet:

```
mrscript assist "derive age groups under 35, 35-54, 55+" --type derive --out age_group.mrs
```

`assist` needs an AI provider: set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for Anthropic's API, or
`MRSCRIPT_ASSIST_URL` (+ `MRSCRIPT_ASSIST_MODEL`) to use a **local model** (Ollama,
LM Studio) with no key and no cost. With no provider it prints a clear error and
exits — the rest of `mrscript` is unaffected. See [NL
Assistant](../reference/assist.md).

## Suggest nets/recodes from value labels (`suggest`)

When a variable's grouping is *implied by its labels* — a 5-point scale wants
top/bottom-box nets, a brand list wants themed nets — let `suggest` read the labels
and propose a validated `DERIVE`. You name the variable; it picks the grouping.

```
mrscript suggest $q1 --data survey.sav
```

```mrs
DERIVE @q1_grp
    NET "Agree (Top 2 Box)"
        STUB 4 WHERE $q1 = 4
        STUB 5 WHERE $q1 = 5
    ENDNET
    STUB 3 "Neutral" WHERE $q1 = 3
    NET "Disagree (Bottom 2 Box)"
        STUB 1 WHERE $q1 = 1
        STUB 2 WHERE $q1 = 2
    ENDNET
END DERIVE
```

It auto-detects whether the variable is an ordered **scale** (→ top/bottom-box) or
**nominal** (→ thematic nets); force it with `--kind scale|nominal`. `suggest` shares
the same AI-provider setup as `assist` (Anthropic or a local model) and validates the
DERIVE against your data before printing it. See [Recode
Suggester](../reference/suggest.md).

## Code open-ends into themes (`code`)

Turn a free-text verbatim column into countable themes. Write a small **frame** of
themes, then `code` reads the verbatim straight from the survey data and writes a
0/1 matrix (one column per theme) plus a codebook you can re-`SOURCE`.

```csv
code,label
1,Price / value for money
2,Taste / flavour
3,Health / natural ingredients
4,Brand trust / reputation
```

```
mrscript code survey.mrs $why_brand --frame frame.csv \
      --out coded.csv --codebook coded.json --ai
```

`--ai` suggests initial assignments via the same provider setup as `assist`; drop it
for an all-zero **manual shell** you fill in yourself. The output re-imports as a
labelled multi-response group — close the loop and tabulate the themes:

```mrs
SOURCE "coded.csv" CODEBOOK "coded.json"

TABLE "Reasons for choice"
    STUBS $why_brand_1, $why_brand_2, $why_brand_3, $why_brand_4
    BANNER $gender
    STATS n, col_pct
END TABLE
```

The verbatim variable must be `open_end`; to net a *categorical* use
[`suggest`](#suggest-netsrecodes-from-value-labels-suggest) instead. See [Open-End
Coding](../reference/coding.md).

## Drill a cell to its respondents (`provenance`)

When a client asks *"who are the 2 people in the Strongly-Agree / Male cell?"*, drill
the cell back to its respondent IDs — no dropping into SPSS to rebuild the filter:

```
mrscript provenance survey.mrs --table 1 --row 5 --col "$gender = 1" --data survey.sav
```

```
Table 1 - Overall Satisfaction
  Cell:  Strongly Agree (code 5)  x  Male (A)
  Base:  5 in column        Count: 2

  Contributing respondents (%RESPID):
    respondent_id    weight     row
    5                -          4
    10               -          9
```

Address the cell by `--table N` (or a table `NAME`/title), `--row` (a stub code,
stub label, or **NET** label), and `--col` (a column **label**, sig **letter**,
0-based **index**, a `"$var = code"` **condition**, or omit it for the **Total**).
Add `--out worklist.csv` to write the full respondent list (with weights). Weighted
tables report the weighted count Σw; stacked (`LEVEL`) tables list the exposure rows
with the real respondent behind each. See [Cell Provenance](../reference/provenance.md).

---

## Reproducible runs and audit trails (`--out-store`)

When you need to prove *exactly* what script and data produced a set of tabs —
for QC, for a client, or for a future `table-diff` — add `--out-store DIR` to any
`mrscript run` or `mrscript export` invocation:

```bash
# Monday: produce and archive
mrscript run survey.mrs --out-store archive/week22/

# Thursday: corrected script, re-run
mrscript run survey_v2.mrs --out-store archive/week22_v2/

# Diff the two runs; provenance header shows which scripts + commits were used
mrscript table-diff archive/week22/ archive/week22_v2/
```

`--out-store DIR` saves two things to `DIR`:

- The `TableStore` (`manifest.json` + `cells.parquet`) — a replayable snapshot of
  all produced tables, loadable by future `mrscript table-diff` without re-running.
- An **`audit.json`** — records the script SHA-256, data file SHA-256, git commit /
  branch / dirty flag, mrscript version, Python version, and the effective `CONFIG`
  values used for the run.

For `mrscript export`, `--out-store` is additive: the formatted output (CSV or
Excel) is still written as usual, and the store + audit are also saved.

When you later diff two archived runs, `mrscript table-diff` reads the
`audit.json` from each side and prepends a provenance summary:

```

Different `sha` values confirm the script changed between runs; `git dirty: true`
warns that there were uncommitted edits at run time.

## Load a Triple-S file

Triple-S (`.sss` + companion data file) is the standard interchange format exported
by most fieldwork platforms (Confirmit, Decipher, SurveyToGo, Forsta, Nebu). Point
Tablix at the `.sss` metadata file and supply the companion data file with `DATA`.

```mrs
SOURCE "survey.sss" AS triple_s DATA "survey.dat"
%RESPID = $resp_id

// Declare missing codes from the SSS (not auto-applied)
VARIABLE $gender MISSING 9 END VARIABLE

TABLE "Gender"
    STUBS  $gender
    BANNER $region
    STATS  n, col_pct, sig
END TABLE
```

The data file is detected as **fixed-width** (`.dat`, `.asc`) or **CSV** (`.csv`,
`.tsv`) by extension. No other change is needed — everything downstream (DERIVE,
STACK, tables, output) works identically to SPSS data.

**Multiple-response variables** in the SSS expand automatically. A `multiple` variable
named `media` with codes 1/2/3 creates columns `$media_1`, `$media_2`, `$media_3`
(each `multi_binary`):

```mrs
SOURCE "survey.sss" AS triple_s DATA "survey.dat"

TABLE "Media channels"
    STUBS  $media_1, $media_2, $media_3
    STATS  n, col_pct
END TABLE
```

See [Triple-S format](../reference/data-input.md#triple-s) for the full variable
type mapping and caching behaviour.

## Load a fixed-width ASCII file

Fixed-width `.dat` files (legacy MRDCL / Quantum / government datasets) need a JSON
schema describing the column layout. Pass the schema with `SCHEMA`.

**layout.json** (create this alongside your `.dat` file):
```json
{
  "columns": [
    {"name": "resp_id", "start": 1,  "width": 5, "label": "Respondent ID"},
    {"name": "gender",  "start": 6,  "width": 1, "label": "Gender",
     "values": {"1": "Male", "2": "Female"}},
    {"name": "score",   "start": 7,  "width": 5, "decimals": 2,
     "label": "Score"},
    {"name": "age",     "start": 12, "width": 3, "label": "Age"}
  ]
}
```

**script.mrs:**
```mrs
SOURCE "raw.dat" AS ascii SCHEMA "layout.json"
%RESPID = $resp_id

VARIABLE $gender MISSING 9 END VARIABLE

TABLE "Gender breakdown"
    STUBS  $gender
    STATS  n, col_pct
END TABLE
```

- `start`/`width` are **1-indexed** character positions.
- `decimals` converts an implied decimal — raw `"04525"` with `decimals=2` → `45.25`.
- A blank (all-spaces) field becomes `null`.
- The `CODEBOOK` clause can layer additional metadata on top of the schema.

See [ASCII fixed-width format](../reference/data-input.md#ascii) for the full schema
specification.

## Share results as a browser file (HTML viewer)

Export all tables from a run to a single self-contained HTML file that opens offline
in any browser — no Excel, no server, no CDN. Attach it to a Slack thread, email it,
or open it directly on a laptop without any software installed.

```sh
mrscript export script.mrs results.html
mrscript export script.mrs results.html --data latest_wave.sav
```

The file includes a clickable table of contents, a per-table search box that hides
non-matching rows, and sortable column headers (click to sort by that column's
percentage). All table kinds are included: banner tables, GRID, SUMMARY, TURF, and
cross-table outputs.

See [Interactive HTML viewer](../reference/output.md#html) in the output reference.
